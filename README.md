**PHP Project Base** is a clean and organized boilerplate for starting PHP applications.

It follows modern development practices with a layered architecture, including:

- Entity, Repository, Service, and Controller layers
- PSR-compliant autoloading and folder structure
- A minimal router and entry point setup
- Ready to scale for APIs, admin panels, or SaaS platforms

This project is ideal as a starting point for building maintainable and modular PHP applications.
